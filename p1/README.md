There is a bug that is not always repeatable when playing the game.  Something to do with setting/getting the text property of the cell object.  If the text property is initially set to anything other than null or "" it works.

**[Vue warn]: Error in v-on handler: "TypeError: Cannot set property 'text' of undefined"**

If I have time I will investigate and fix it.
