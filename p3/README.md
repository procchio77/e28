## Notes for instructor
1. used local storage to keep tabs on what the latest selection of sector the user makes.
2. Initially only load Stocks / sectors.  Filter takes place with vuex getter.
3. Only load order history to vuex when user first navigates to it.
4. Fixed the router issue (.htaccess) on production for project2 and this project.
